# CultureBridge: AI-Powered Real-Time Caption & Translation System

## üåç Project Overview

**CultureBridge** is an intelligent desktop application that provides real-time captions, translations, and voice dubbing for any audio playing on your computer. Built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), the system employs multiple AI agents that work together to break down language barriers and make digital content accessible to everyone.

### Vision Statement
*"Bridging cultures through intelligent, real-time language processing - making every conversation accessible to everyone, everywhere."*

## üéØ Core Problem Statement

In our increasingly global digital world, language barriers prevent millions of people from:
- Participating in international business meetings
- Accessing educational content in foreign languages
- Enjoying entertainment from other cultures
- Collaborating effectively with international teams
- Understanding important information in emergency situations

Current solutions are either:
- **Too limited**: Only work in specific apps
- **Too slow**: Require manual activation and processing
- **Too basic**: Simple word-for-word translation without context
- **Too expensive**: Enterprise-only solutions

## ‚ú® Solution: Intelligent Multi-Agent System

CultureBridge uses Google's Agent Development Kit to create a sophisticated multi-agent system that:

1. **Listens intelligently** to all system audio
2. **Understands context** (meeting vs. video vs. music)
3. **Translates thoughtfully** (formal vs. casual style)
4. **Ensures quality** through continuous monitoring
5. **Delivers seamlessly** via captions and voice dubbing

## ü§ñ Agent Architecture

### Audio Context Agent
**Role**: The "Listener" - Analyzes incoming audio streams
- **Detects source type**: Zoom meeting, YouTube video, Spotify music, system notifications
- **Assesses audio quality**: Noise levels, speaker count, clarity
- **Determines priority**: Business meeting (high) vs. background music (low)
- **Recommends processing**: Real-time vs. batch, enhanced models vs. standard

**Decision Example**: 
*"Detected Zoom meeting with 3 speakers, high audio quality, business context ‚Üí Use enhanced speech model, prioritize accuracy over speed, apply formal translation style"*

### Translation Strategy Agent
**Role**: The "Linguist" - Plans optimal translation approach
- **Analyzes context**: Meeting formality, industry terminology, cultural nuances
- **Selects style**: Formal business language vs. casual conversation
- **Chooses approach**: Direct translation vs. cultural adaptation
- **Optimizes for audience**: Technical accuracy vs. general understanding

**Decision Example**:
*"Business meeting context detected ‚Üí Apply formal register, preserve technical terms, use conservative cultural adaptation, prioritize accuracy over creativity"*

### Quality Control Agent
**Role**: The "Reviewer" - Monitors and improves output quality
- **Assesses confidence**: Speech recognition accuracy, translation fluency
- **Detects errors**: Mistranslations, missed words, context failures
- **Triggers reprocessing**: When quality falls below thresholds
- **Learns patterns**: Common error types, improvement opportunities

**Decision Example**:
*"Transcription confidence 65% (below 70% threshold) ‚Üí Request reprocessing with noise reduction, flag for human review, maintain original audio for backup"*

### Voice Synthesis Agent
**Role**: The "Speaker" - Creates natural voice dubbing
- **Analyzes original speaker**: Gender, age, accent, speaking pace, emotion
- **Selects target voice**: Matching characteristics in target language
- **Optimizes prosody**: Timing, emphasis, emotional tone
- **Synchronizes delivery**: Audio alignment, natural pacing

**Decision Example**:
*"Original speaker: Male, middle-aged, confident tone ‚Üí Select Spanish male voice model, maintain confident delivery, preserve original timing patterns"*

### Master Orchestrator Agent
**Role**: The "Conductor" - Coordinates all agents and manages workflow
- **Receives audio input**: From system audio capture
- **Consults specialists**: Routes decisions to appropriate agents
- **Manages pipeline**: Coordinates timing and dependencies
- **Delivers results**: Provides unified output to user interface
- **Handles failures**: Graceful degradation and error recovery
